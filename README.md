Introducing IconCaptcha, a self-hosted captcha solution that's designed to be fast, user-friendly, and highly customizable. Unlike other captchas, IconCaptcha spares users the need of deciphering hard-to-read text images, solving complex math problems, or engaging with perplexing puzzle games. Instead, with IconCaptcha it's as straightforward as comparing up to 8 icons and selecting the least common one.

IconCaptcha doesn't just prioritize users; it's also developer-friendly. In just a few steps, you can have IconCaptcha integrated into your website. Even if you're new to PHP and JavaScript, installing IconCaptcha is a straightforward process. The included demo pages in this repository provide all the necessary code to get IconCaptcha up and running. For more in-depth insights, take a moment to explore the information provided on this page and the wiki.
